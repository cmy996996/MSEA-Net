# MSEA-Net

High-Accuracy Follicle Segmentation in Ultrasound Images Using Multi-Scale Enhanced Attention and U-Net

## Project Overview

This repository contains the implementation of MSEA-Net, a deep learning model for accurate follicle segmentation in ultrasound images.  
The model leverages multi-scale feature fusion and attention mechanisms to improve segmentation performance.

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset (place it in the designated folder).  
2. Run the training script:

```bash
python train.py
